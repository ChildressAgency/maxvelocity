                  </header>
                  <p>Background: I have attended MVT three times now, to include last year's CLC and this year's CLC. I have also attended well over 20 training events with other instructors (mostly manipulation stuff, a smattering of tactics), was a Hospital Corpsman in the Navy, and am currently and infantryman in the Army National Guard.</p>
                  <p>Discussion: This is my second time at CLC, and right off the bat I would like to say it was better than last year. Being one of the four repeat students, I can say with confidence that I got more value out of this the second time, and that CLC is definitively worth the financial and opportunity costs.</p>
                  <p>Mechanically, CLC is an eight day class with each of 13 students getting on appointment as the squad leader, multiple opportunities to be a team leader, and the reaminder being as a regular joe. Most days will contain two missions, one inteh morning and one in the evening; each mission consists of a mission brief delivered by the Squad Leader, a period of mission-specific rehearsals directed by the Squa Leader, the mission itself, and then an on-the-ground AAR. Missions are any of the traditional small unit missions (raid, ambush, etc), and are run against live enemy (called the "opposing forces", AKA OPFOR). This year all the students except two were MVT grads, and that higher lebel of indiviual skill was very beneficial throughout the class, as it allowed leaders to have a degree of trust that their subordinates would know what to do. also w we had a great group of guys (and a gal) this year, who managed to get along very well, with only a few personality clashes.</p>
                  <p>A quick word on our training weapons: last year's CLC was run with UTM, and this year was planned to be UTM as well. However, shortly before the class started UTM had some rather significant QC issues, and Max made the decision to switch to AirSim rifles. I won't lie, I was originally pretty skeptical, and came to the class curious and mildly apprehensive about the new rifles. After a full week with the new AirSim stuff I can defniitively say that it is better in the woods., It's probably a wash with UTM inside sturctures, but overall, AirSim takes the cake because it is just massivley chearper and more accessible. So please don't boo-hoo the class out of some misplaced machismo directed at the traning tools.</p>
                  <p>Fundimentally, CLC is akin to miniature Ranger School. It teaches, and selects for, leadership through the behicle of small unit tactics. It trains one's grasp of the fundamental principles of war and one's "grip" of a chaotic situation. It develops and conditions the ability to follow order, which is curcial for any leader. What you get out of CLC is entirely unavailable at any other civilian tranier I know of, anywhere in the United States. If you are the type of person who will read this review, the n you should probably attend the class.</p>
                  <p>Another key differentiating factor between many training venues and CLC (MVT generally, but CLC specifically) is that chaos is the real teacher at CLC. To wit: you can lead people pretty easily in a predicatble situation (even if it is heighly dangerous) but leading and controlling people in highly dangerous and unpredicatable situations is wa whole other can of worms. Then add to that problem the fact that you have to lead through people (in the case of CLC), a squa leader using his team leaders, who themselves are using their team) and you can see the unique value you get. Learning how to grip your people and operate int he chaos is the key to csuccess.</p>
                  <p>I certainly got my money's worth out of the class. I developed myself in ways that aren't available anywhere outside of the military (ask me how I know) throguh gritty, realistic traning; I learned more about tactics in a week than a year of reading mbooks would do; I became a better follower, which is just as important as being a good leader (one presupposes the other), and I didi it all in the company of some amazing people. Oh yeah, did I mention we all looked cool while we were at it?</p>
                  <p>Summary: if you are serious about learning how to fight, not just how to shoot (which is only the smallest aprt of fighting) you really need to attend MVT (because no one else teaches cmall unit tactics to civilians in the same way that MVT does). If you further think that you may fight with other people, you need to bring them to MVT as well, and then at least some of you need ot attend CLC> The Army doesn't send people into combar without organized, repeated practice at SUT, and if you think you're goig to go into combat with your group - without rigorous, valid training - and survive you are either ignorant of the facts or delusional.</p>
